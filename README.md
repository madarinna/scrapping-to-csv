# README for Project BE-1

This project is using Puppeteer for scrapping the website of Tokopedia. We will scrap the data from Handphone Category. In this script, we will fetch the item's name, price, image URL, rating and description. After we fetch the data, we will store it in the csv file. The file will be generated when you run the script.

We also include some unit testing using Jest.

## How to run

`npm install` to install the dependencies <br>

`node index.js` to start the script

`npm test` to run the test cases
